PHP Library (with web interface) that parses the text of a document in one of several ways (will be selectable by user in the future) to create a MIDI file based on the content of the document.  This can then be used later (through GarageBand, Logic, FruityLoops, or any other DAP environment) to further produce audio based on the document.
